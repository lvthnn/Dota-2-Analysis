# Dota 2 Data Parser
Uses Dotabuff's [Manta parser](https://github.com/dotabuff/manta) to extract match data from game replays.
To start, clone the Github repository into the directory of your choice:

```git clone https://github.com/lvthnn/Dota2_DataMining```

You will also have to install the Go modules from Dotabuff for the `parse.go` script to work:

```
go get github.com/dotabuff/manta
```
